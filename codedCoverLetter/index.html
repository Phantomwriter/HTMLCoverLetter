					Good Day,<br/>
					My name is Howard Livingston and I'm writing in regards to the position on Craigslist for a paid internship.<br/>
					There was no specific set of instructions on how to reply to the ad so I decided to send you this hand-coded e-mail that will serve as a cover letter<br/>
					with links to my resume, portfolio and code repository.
					<br/>
					<br/>
					I am currently enrolled full-time in an accelerated, online Bachelors Degree program for programming and mobile application development
 					and have been attending school for the last two and a half years. My expected graduation date is next February.
					I feel my skill-set is strong enough for me to contribute to the continuing success of your company in an internship capacity.<br/>
					My skills are sharp, my outlook is always positive and am anxious to work with like-minded individuals in a field I've been training in for years.
					I'm an individual who strives for excellence, professionalism and comradery in the workplace.<br/>
					
					I have not updated my Dropbox resume, but as of January 24th, my full-time position of five years at a local hospital was disolved, along with 104<br/>
					other employees, after a company buy-out.<br/>
					I wish to pursue my career as a programmer/App Builder. I can jump into this internship position and gain real-world experience which is vital when landing that first programming job.
					<br/>
					<br/>
																	DESIGN
					<br/>				        

					When I decided to enter the field of mobile app development, my intention was to create more than just games or widgets.

					Through my degree program, I have learned many new skills that have expanded my vision of what can be accomplished through mobile technology. 

					My experience with Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator is minimal but sufficient for editing and designing on a basic level (logos, altering photos, resizing images for mobile use, etc.).</br>

					</br>
																			TECH					
                    <br/>
				       

					Here are some of my stronger skills:<br/>
					Mobile application design and layout.<br/>
					HTML5, CSS, and jQuery.<br/>
					Familiar with both the iOS (currently use a Macbook Pro) and Windows operating systems.<br/>
					Developing apps for iOS and Android<br/>
					Microsoft office suite...all of it.</br>
					Using the internet to find solutions to coding problems.</br>
					Experience creating videos using Apple I-Movie. My degree program has incorporated this into its curriculum</br>
					and would certainly be useful when trying to walk customers through a new interface or any other instructional videos that may be needed.<br/>
					
					<br/>

																	ONLINE COLLABORATION

					<br/>
					I have used Github, GoToMeeting and Google Hangouts to meet and collaborate with students and instructors. I have also utilized Google Drive, as I have in this e-mail to share files and allow other users access in order to work on projects together.<br/>
					<br/>


																WHAT ELSE CAN I BRING TO THE TABLE?
					<br/>
					I would be a strong candidate to LEARN different programming languages from within the company.I have learned many new languages in my degree program that can attest to my ability to implement new coding concepts.</br> 
					Multitasking and filling whatever role is needed in order to ensure the success of daily operations.<br/>
					I am always eager to find solutions to new problems.<br/>
					A high level of maturity and confidence.<br/>
					<br/>


																	      IN CLOSING

					<br/>
					I believe I have a lot to offer and am excited to jump in and <br/>
					get working in a field Iâ€™ve been training for over the last two years.<br/>
					I need to be immersed in this field and work with like-minded colleagues in<br/>
					order to bring my skills to the next level while delivering a strong work ethic<br/>
					and positive attitude to the workplace.<br/>
					
					Below you will will find links to view my resume, online portfolio and Github code repository.</br>
					</br>

</br>
					<br/>I thank you for your time and I hope to hear from you soon!<br/>
					<br/>
